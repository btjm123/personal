              My first encounter with programming was through the Inspect
              Element Function. Since then I started learning a bunch of
              languages and frameworks and happened to really like it a lot.

              Programming empowers me to build products that have a real impact
              on people lives. I also enjoy solving algorithmic and mathematical
              problems with code.
