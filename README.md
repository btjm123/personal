## Introduction
This simple webpage serves as a way for me to document my programming journey and a way to consolidate my projects, past experience and awards into one single page application. The web app was bootstrapped with **NextJS, React, TypeScript and TailWindCSS**.

Even though I didn't need the backend or file-based routing features that NextJS offers, NextJS offers SSR (i.e Server-Side Rendering), which is pivotal in enchancing SEO (i.e Search Engine Optimisation) and increasing visibility in today's increasingly saturated digital space.

## A Quick Preview of Draft 1

To Dos:
- Add Projects Section (maybe a card with box-shadow properties?)
- Add hyperlinks to GitHub, LinkedIn, Youtube Channel
- Add Dark Mode
- Add Meta Tags for SEO
- Add Profile Picture (maybe a circular icon?)
- Add a contact form (really?)
- Add a referrals section (probably not tho)
